 <h2>NuTyX 26.02.2 available with cards 3.4.3</h2>
  <p>
   Spiky and me are happy to announce the new version of NuTyX 26.02.2 and cards 3.4.3 .
<h2>The short version</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>
    sysV is at the end of its life, only one initialization system: systemd.
   </li>
   <li>
    Switching from sysV to systemd without reinstalling is not a good idea.
   </li>
   <li>
    NuTyX sysV maintained until the end of 2026.
   </li>
   <li>
    3 ISO graphics: XFCE, GNOME and KDE6.
   </li>
   <li>
    1 Basic non-graphic ISO for pros.
   </li>
  </ol>
 <h2>The long version</h2>
   <p>
    After nearly 19 years, NuTyX slowly abandoned the sysV initialization system developed more than 40 years ago (1983).
    This means concretely:
   <p>
    Only the following packages will continue to receive updates until December 2026:
    <ol>
     <li>
      The kernels. Note that the kernel-510, kernel-515, kernel-66 and
kernel-612 also come to the end of their life in December 2026.
     </li>
     <li>
      Firefox and Thunderbird
     </li>
     <li>
      Discord and Telegram
     </li>
     <li>
      XFCE 4.20
     </li>
     <li>
      Security updates
     </li>
    </ol>
   <p>
    Now, the distribution focuses on a single initialization system: systemd.
   <p>
    The two main offices GNOME and KDE6 will soon no longer be operational under sysV.
   <p>
    systemd will stop compatibility with sysv in its next version 260.
   <p>
    <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/read.html">The linux from scratch</a> team also decided to stop the sys-V version by the end of 2026.
   <p>
    The transition from sysV to systemd is possible but is not recommended at all.
    On the other hand, a new installation keeps your personal datas.

 <h2>Installing/Migrating from sysV to systemd</h2>
  <h3>Good to know</h3>
   <p>
    The installation requires 4 Gyga bytes of RAM and a disk space of 20 GB minimum for the system.
   <p>
    The installation can be done in bios or uefi mode. The detection is done automatically.
   <p>
    If you are lucky enough to be able to install in uefi mode, the uefi partition size can be very small.
    Attention all machines do not accept an efi partition below 50 MB (virtualbox e.g.).
   <p>
    To test the ISO gnome in virtual, it is imperative to activate the 3d in the virtual machine.
    Preferably use virtualbox.

  <h3>Methods of installation</h3>
   <p>
    The installation is very fast and very safe, indeed the installer will never format a partition without asking the user.
   <p>
    So if you do not replace the partition on which your data is
located, you do not fail to lose your personal data. When in doubt, make
 a backup. ;)
   <p>
    You have the choice between 3 installation modes:
    <ol>
     <li>
      Direct
     </li>
     <li>
      From the live
     </li>
     <li>
      For savvy users, from the live via the installation script 'install-nutyx'
     </li>
    </ol>
   <p>
    4 ISO are available:
    The basic system (without graphical interface), XFCE4, GNOME and KDE6.
   <p>
    They are available on <a href="downloads">the download page.</a>

 <h2>Update (only possible if you are already on the NuTyX systemd)</h2>
   <p>
    Do the following:
   </p><pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo cards upgrade</kbd></pre>
   <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo cards upgrade
sudo shutdown -r 0</kbd></pre>
