     It's done in a few steps:
     <ul>
      <li>
        Send an email to one of &lt;mailing_list_name&gt;-request@nutyx.org (<i>nutyx-support-request@nutyx.org</i> for example) by specifying:
       <b><i>subscribe</i></b> as the subject.
      <li>
       You will receive a confirmation mail. Check your spam mail.
      <li>
       Simply answer this last email by choosing "Reply" on your favorite email software.

   <h2>NuTyX is not a multi-lib</h2>
    <p>
     It takes much more time to build up a multilib distribution.
     Normally all the libraries need to be compiled in both 64 and 32 bit.
    <p>
     Today, it's not possible to produce a multilib because there are links created at construction / installation of NuTyX (lib64->lib) under /lib and /usr.

   <h2>The installer doesn't allow me to specify a separate /home partition</h2>
    <p>
     This question has been asked many times.
     I will try to answer it as clearly  as possible.
    <p>
     Modern users often have a lot of data on their computers.
     The size of the home folder can quickly become very large.
     MP3 files, photos and videos are big files.
    <p>
     Imagine that you have a 250 GB hard disk.
     You say &quot;OK, I'll take 100 GB for the system and 150 GB for my personal data.&quot;
     Great! You just cut your disk into two pieces, and the home partition will fill up more quickly in proportion to its size than if you had retained a single partition.
     It would be nice if we could reinstall NuTyX when we wanted without having to cut the hard disk into separate partitions to preserve personal data.
     <u>That's exactly how the NuTyX installer works</u>.
    <ul>
     <li>
      The installer will never format a partition that is already formated, without manual intervention.
    <li>
      If you have a distribution (NuTyX or any other) with personal data and the system on the same partition,
      the installer will tell you during the installation process that there is already a distribution there but will not offer to format the partition.
      You will need to delete the <b>  /var, /proc, /sys, /usr, /sbin,</b> and <b>/etc </b> folders, but other folders such as <b>/home</b> and <b>/MP3</b> will not be touched.
      So your data is safe. 
    <li>
     Today it is very easy to configure a file server based on NFS, so that users could have their home folders on a remote server.
    <li>
     To summarise: creating a separate home partition today is unecessary, at least with NuTyX.
     It's worth asking why Apple's MacOS operating system never recommended this.
    </ul>

   <h2>Building packages in a chroot. Why ?</h2>
       All the binary packages are split into base packages and sub-packages (devel, doc, man, etc); in most cases, only the base package will be installed.
       It means:
       <div class="important"><img alt="[Important]" src="../graphics/caution.gif" />
        if the user wants to compile a package not available in binaries,
        <a href="build-in-chroot">he (she) will have to compile those packages in a chroot</a>,
        otherwise the compilation will always fail because of missing dependencies.
       </div>
      <p>
       Building packages is always done in a chroot via the <a href="mybld">mybld</a> command.
      <p>
       This avoids two important problems:
       <ul>
        <li>
         The mybld command will automatically install ALL dependencies (base, devel, man, service, etc).
        No risk of ending up with missing dependencies.
        <li>
         The mybld command will automatically install a minimalist base NuTyX before compiling.
         No risk of forgetting dependencies.
         No risk of having unwanted dependencies.
       </ul>


   <h2>Is NuTyX (from 9.0 on) a rolling release ?</h2>
    <p>
     Yes.
     After various successfulls tests and reinstallations, NuTyX is now consider as a rolling release.

   <h2>How to activate the root account ?</h2>
    <p>
     As default, NuTyX does not activate the root account but, if you wish to compile your own packages, it may be a good idea to activate the root account.
     It's very simple, type:
     <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo setup-nutyx -cu</kbd></pre>
     and choose <b>root</b> as user
     <p>
       <img src="graphics/faq/ActivateRoot1.png" alt="Figure 1: Specify the root account" title="Figure 1: Specify the root account"/>
     <p>
      choose a new password
     <p>
      <img src="graphics/faq/ActivateRoot2.png" alt="Figure 2: Specify the password" title="Figure 2: Specify the password"/>
     <p>
      and confirm the new password
    <p>
      <img src="graphics/faq/ActivateRoot3.png" alt="Figure 3: Confirm the password" title="Figure 3: Confirm the password"/>
     <p>
      and you're done.
   <h2>Can't compile C/C++ code with gcc ?</h2>
    <p>
     All the development packages are in... the devel group means: 
     You need to install them if you want to make some development.
     The easiest way is to install cards.devel package which it going to
     pull all the necessary dependencies.
     <pre class="command_user"><kbd>get cards.devel</kbd></pre>
