 <h2>What's new ?</h2>
  <h3>install-nutyx</h3>
  <p>
   It's now possible to use the <pre class="command_user"><kbd>paste-nutyx</kbd></pre>
   command when sharing output are needed.
   Very usefull, Thanks to Spiky for the idea
  <p>
   The <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo generate-nutyx</kbd></pre>
   command when we want to (re)generate an ISO.
  <p>
   And finally the <pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo chroot-nutyx</kbd></pre>
   command let you enter into an NuTyX installed in a directory.

  <h3>mybld</h3>
   The <pre class="command_user"><kbd>mybld</kbd></pre>
   command install a chroot and all dependencies faster.
   Only .devel and .lib are indeed necessary for building a package.

 <h2>Upgrade process</h2>
  <p>
   A simple:
 </p><pre class="command_user"><kbd>sudo cards upgrade</kbd></pre>
   will make it.
   
 <h2>Thanks</h2>

 <h2>Warnings</h2>
  <p> 
   Some project get inspired by NuTyX.
  <div class="important"><img alt="[Important]" src="../graphics/caution.gif" >
    If you use directly thoses distributions, you're signing up for some pain:
  </div>
   
   <ul>
    <li>
      Lack of continuity.
    <li>
      Lack of support.
    <li>
      The lack of knowledge about the finer points of distribution leads to certain more than dubious choices.
    <li>
      Many binaries are poorly constructed and/or do not work.
    <li>
      Features of cards and NuTyX discarded.
    <li>
      Impossibility of having an up-to-date card version given the constant evolutions.
   </ul>
